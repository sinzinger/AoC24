"""
--- Part Two ---
The engineers seem concerned; the total calibration result you gave them is nowhere close to being within safety tolerances. Just then, you spot your mistake: some well-hidden elephants are holding a third type of operator.

The concatenation operator (||) combines the digits from its left and right inputs into a single number. For example, 12 || 345 would become 12345. All operators are still evaluated left-to-right.

Now, apart from the three equations that could be made true using only addition and multiplication, the above example has three more equations that can be made true by inserting operators:

156: 15 6 can be made true through a single concatenation: 15 || 6 = 156.
7290: 6 8 6 15 can be made true using 6 * 8 || 6 * 15.
192: 17 8 14 can be made true using 17 || 8 + 14.
Adding up all six test values (the three that could be made before using only + and * plus the new three that can now be made by also using ||) produces the new total calibration result of 11387.

Using your new knowledge of elephant hiding spots, determine which equations could possibly be true. What is their total calibration result?
